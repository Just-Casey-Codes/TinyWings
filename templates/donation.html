  <p class="fantasy-subtext">🪄 Hi there, fellow Dragon Keeper! 🐲<br>

TinyWings is a passion project, built with love and zero cost to players
      — but I'd love to take it even further. With your support,
      I hope to grow Tiny Wings into a mobile app and expanded game,
      filled with more dragons, deeper exploration, and enchanting new features. 💫<br>

If you’ve enjoyed hatching your first egg or exploring with your dragons, consider leaving a
      little magic here to help fuel future updates! Every bit of support keeps the fire burning. 🔥<br>

Thank you for being part of the journey. 🧡<br>
Who will you hatch next?
